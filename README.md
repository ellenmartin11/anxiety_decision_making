# Decision-Making and Anxiety
Research project submitted for the Computational Psychiatry Conference (2024) during my time at the Yale Rutledge Lab. Visit https://ellenmartin11.github.io/anxiety_decision_making/SummaryAnalysesPastFuture.html for all code and results. 

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of over 5000 participants' worth of data collected remotely, via smartphone app called the Happiness Project.

### Key Results

- We found a negative correlation between raw happiness and risk-taking in the gain domain. That is, participants were happier the fewer risks they took in the gain domain for the first play of an uncertain risky decision-making game (rho = -0.093, p < .001)
- This was consistent across multiple plays (rho = -0.075, p = 0.036).
- There was a reversed effect in the loss domain, where there was a positive correlation between raw happiness and risk-taking in the loss domain. Participants were happier the more trials they took risks on in the loss domain (rho = 0.073, p = 0.001).
- This was not consistent across multiple plays (p > 0.05).
